# # Quantum oscillators: optimal SNAP gates
# **Engineering fast, leakage-free gates in superconducting cavity-qubit systems**
# 
# BOULDER OPAL provides you with a flexible framework to optimize and simulate quantum systems with various levels of complexity. This application note demonstrates such flexibility by considering the optimization of a gate performed using multiple levels of a quantum oscillator coupled to a qubit. In particular, youâ€™ll learn how to suppress leakage to neighboring energy levels in Selective Number-dependent Arbitrary Phase (SNAP) gates applied to a superconducting cavity coupled to a transmon qubit.
# 
# The high dimensionality of the Hilbert space of quantum oscillators can be viewed as a resource to encode and process quantum information. However, in some cases, this multiplicity of levels can be detrimental to gate performance as operations intended to occur in a particular subspace end up populating unwanted levels. In practice, long pulse durations are used to narrow the operation's spectral range and, consequently, prevent leakage to neighboring levels. Longer gates, however, expose the system to other limiting factors such as spontaneous decay and cavity losses. In this notebook, you'll have the opportunity to use BOULDER OPAL optimization tools to make SNAP gates faster while suppressing leakage at the same time.
# 
# The notebook contains two sections, as follows. In the first section, you'll look at the detrimental effects of leakage in standard implementations of SNAP gates built on slow control $\pi$ rotations. In the second section, you'll use BOULDER OPAL to generate fast SNAP gates using significantly higher Rabi rates, which optimally suppress leakage across a multitude of Fock states at once.

# ## Model of the oscillator-qubit system

# The system consists of a superconducting transmon system coupled to a cavity in the dispersive limit, as given by the following Hamiltonian:
# 
# $$H = \omega_C a^\dagger a + \frac{K}{2} (a^\dagger)^2 a^2 + \omega_T b^\dagger b + \chi a^\dagger a b^\dagger b + \left(\gamma (t) b + H.c.\right), $$
# 
# where $\omega_C$ is the cavity transition frequency, $a$ is the annihilation operator of a cavity excitation, $b$ is the annihilation operator of the transmon system, $K$ is the Kerr coefficient, $\omega_T$ is the transmon frequency, $\chi$ is the dispersive shift and $\gamma(t)= I(t) + i Q(t)$ is the complex drive amplitude. The basis states in the Hilbert space will be denoted by $|i,j\rangle =|i\rangle_T \otimes |j\rangle_C$, for the transmon number state $|i\rangle_T$ and cavity number state $|j\rangle_C$. 
# 
# In the remainder of notebook, the transmon system will be operated as a qubit formed by the lowest two energy levels, while the cavity will be populated by the first $n_c$ Fock states. Note that in this configuration, the qubit will exhibit a spectrum of transition frequencies, set $\chi$ apart, each corresponding to a different excitation state of the cavity.

# ## Standard SNAP gate
# 
# The objective of a SNAP gate is to impart a phase of $\theta$ to a target Fock state $j$ of the cavity $|j\rangle_C \rightarrow e^{i\theta} |j\rangle_C $. The [standard implementation](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.137002) of SNAP gates consists of two control $\pi$ pulses applied on the transmon qubit based on a target Fock state of the cavity. The pulses are performed around different axes, offset apart by an angle $\theta$. By the end of the gate,the qubit makes a net $2\pi$ rotation, disentangling from the targeted Fock state while imparting the desired phase $\theta$ to it.

# In[2]:


standard_SNAP_gate_rabi_rate = 0.2 * chi
controls["Standard"] = standard_SNAP_controls(standard_SNAP_gate_rabi_rate, theta)

plot_controls(plt.figure(), controls["Standard"], polar=False)


# The plots display the drive pulses $\gamma(t)$ applied on the transmon qubit. Note that since the standard SNAP gates demand high spectral selectivity, the qubit Rabi rates need to be smaller than the the qubit-cavity coupling $|\gamma| < \chi$, making the gate relatively long, (for example see [Heeres at al.](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.137002)). 

# ### Simulate the system evolution under the standard controls
# 
# You'll begin by simulating the evolution of the system. For this purpose, the first four states of the cavity ($n_c=4$) will be evenly populated while the qubit will be initialized in the ground state $| 0\rangle_T$, making the total  initial state: $(|0, 0\rangle + |0, 1\rangle + |0, 2\rangle + |0, 3\rangle)/\sqrt{4}$. 
# 
# You'll target the first Fock state $|1\rangle_C$ with the SNAP gate, evolving the initial state into $(|0, 0\rangle + e^{i\theta}|0, 1\rangle + |0, 2\rangle + |0, 3\rangle)/\sqrt(4)$, for the gate angle $\theta$, here chosen to be $\theta=\pi/2$.

# Here is the evolution of population (left) and relative phase (right) of the $|0,n\rangle$ states under the SNAP gate targeting $|1\rangle_C$ Fock state. The standard controls induce significant leakage into the neighboring states the which can only be contained by significantly extending the gate duration. Observe that the phase of $|0,1\rangle$ changes from 0 to $\pi/2$ in line with the offset between the two $\pi$-pulse frames, however the phases of neighboring Fock states suffer from a nontrivial combination of leakage and Kerr effect.

# ## Generate a fast SNAP gate optimized for leakage suppression
# 
# You'll now apply BOULDER OPAL to obtain control pulses that perform a faster SNAP while minimizing leakage to other Fock states in the cavity. In this case, the unitary target operation will be $e^{i\theta}|0,1\rangle\langle 0,1|$ projected onto the $|0\rangle\langle 0|_T \otimes I_C $ subspace since the final population of the qubit's excited state will be zero by the end of the gate. In the optimization performed in the cell below, the maximum Rabi rate is also used as the cutoff frequency for the control.

# Plotted are the populations (left) and relative phases (right) of the $|0,n\rangle$ states during the optimized SNAP gate. The control solution you generated using BOULDER OPAL is shorter than the standard gate because it allowed you to leveraged a higher Rabi rate. The impact of leakage is actively controlled throughout the gate ensuring the neighboring Fock states populations follow their individual trajectories back to the original starting point. Observe that the relative phases of the states evolve in such a way that the phase of the targeted $|1\rangle_C$ state reaches the specified target value $\theta =\pi/2$ by the end of the gate, while phases of the neighboring states converge to 0, in the process also eliminating the effects of the Kerr term.
