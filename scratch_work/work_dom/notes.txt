NOT Gate works as usual
Hadamard gate maps state (0 or 1) to a superposition state (different notation for mapped 0 vs 1)
 - represented by the Hadamard matrix

Matrices for these gates are defined in the challenge doc
 - we can choose any theta, but it must remain the same across both gates
 - normally theta = 0
 - phi1 phi2 are arbitrary in 0,2pi


A Qubit is made of two basis states
- the actual state can be any complex valued linear combination of these basis states
- computer starts in 0 state

Measurement from reading a qubit is probabilistic
 - equal to magnitude of its weight (multiply weight by its conjugate)

We can have a time dependent state of qubit
On notation:
 - * means conjugate
 - t (dagger) means conjugate transpose


Error_norm is some form of matrix difference metric

real system does not have direct access to unitaries, only results of projective measurements
We can use CLT to see from a set of trials, how many 

repetition can be used to boost SIGNAL OF ERROR

More realistic cubit has more errors
 - can see list of ways the model becomes more complicated
